# RedBox
A Java-based program designed to emulate a REDBOX. The user must request to return or rent,
then provide a slot number. If the user is renting from an item that has quantity 0, "Out of Stock"
is displayed. If the User is returning, the amount of days will be requested and a fee will be charged,
cost dependent on the item and amount of days out. If the user requests a slot ID that is not valid,
"Invalid Slot ID" is displayed.
